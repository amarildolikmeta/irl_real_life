# Dealing with Multiple Experts and Non-Stationarity in Inverse Reinforcement Learning : An Application to Real-Life Problems
Code of Dealing with Multiple Experts and Non-Stationarity in Inverse Reinforcement Learning : An Application to Real-Life Problems 

This repository contains the implementation of the SIGMA-GIRL algorithm and experiments in real-world data.

## Available algorithms
- [SIGMA-GIRL](algorithms/pgirl.py)
- [MI-SIGMA-GIRL](algorithms/clustering.py)
- [NS-SIGMA-GIRL](run_change_detection_como.py)

## Reproducibility 
To reproduce our results run the following scripts for each use case:
### Highway Use Case
  - The notebook 'notebooks/Highway_use_case' contains the visualization of all the results in the paper together with references to the scripts to run before executing the notebook cells
  - The notebook 'notebooks/Highway_training_curves' contains the visualization of the training curves of the policies trained with the recovered cluster reward functions. It takes in input the training logs, pregenerated and uploaded in the repo (logs/highway/trained). We cannot provide the simulator hence the source code for training, but details can be found in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889020304085
 ### Twitter Use Case
  - To process the raw data into state, action reward tuples execute the 'notebooks/Data Preprocessing Twitter' notebook (reads the raw data found in datasets/twitter)
  - Most of the results of the twitter use case can be reproduced in the repository where Sigma-GIRL was first introduced (https://github.com/gioramponi/sigma-girl-MIIRL)
  - Two extra experiments performed in this paper can be visualized in the notebook 'notebooks/Twitter_use_case' together with references to the scripts to run before executing the notebook cells
### Como Use Case
  - The notebook 'notebooks/Como Use Case' contains the preprocessing of the raw data as well as the presentation of the results generated by running 'run_change_detection_como.py'
